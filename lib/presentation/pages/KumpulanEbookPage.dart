"You see," he says, staring down toward her and lowering his voice so that those passing by won't hear, "one thing you don't know about me is that I like to serve."

It is a surprising thing to hear, coming from a man two meters tall and built like a heavyweight. In fact, he is built exactly like a heavyweight boxer for many years, until he broke something in his back of Schwartznegger-of-vertebraeâ€”briefly hospitalized him, turned up as a real boxer, and now works out as a personal trainer. And yet, though he claims that he will never step foot in the ring again and though he is employed as a trainer at a highly respected newspaper, the girl privately refers to him, both to her friends and to herself, as the German Boxer. It is easier than his name, which means "little gift from the god" because of that.''',

"What do you mean by that?" she asks, though she thinks she might know.

"I mean," he says, stopping to face her, his large hands gentle on her shoulders, "that I want to take care of you. I want to make sure you have everything you need."

The way he says it, so earnestly, makes her heart skip. There is something about his earnestness that moves her, though she cannot quite put her finger on what it is.

They continue walking, and she thinks about the men in her life: her husband, who is kind but distant; her lover before this one, who was passionate but unreliable; and now this man, who seems to offer something different entirely.''',

"Come live with me," he says simply. "Leave everything behind and come live with me."

She looks around his apartment: the neat stack of books on the table, the single photograph of his mother on the mantelpiece, the sparse but clean furniture. It is the apartment of a man who has learned to live with very little but has made that little beautiful.

"I can't," she says, though part of her wants to.

"Why not?"

"Because I have children. Because I have a life. Because I have responsibilities."

He nods, as if he expected this answer. "Then I will wait," he says. "I will wait until you are ready."

The certainty in his voice frightens her a little. It is not the kind of thing men usually say to her.''',

Her husband is traveling for work again. The children are with their grandparents for the week. It seems like the perfect opportunity to disappear for a few days, to see what it might feel like to live a different kind of life.

She tells no one where she is going. She simply leaves a note saying she needs some time alone, and then she takes the train to Berlin.

He is waiting for her at the station, though she did not tell him she was coming. Somehow, he knew. This both disturbs and reassures her.

"You don't have to decide anything right now," he tells her on the third night, as they lie in bed listening to the rain against the windows. "You can take as much time as you need."

But she knows that time is not really what she needs. What she needs is courage, and courage, she is beginning to understand, is not something that comes with time. It is something that comes with decision.

On the morning of the sixth day, she wakes up before him and watches him sleep. His face, so serious when he is awake, looks peaceful, almost boyish. She realizes that she has never seen him look anything but serious, except when he sleeps.''',

She leaves a note on the kitchen table: "Thank you for showing me what it means to be cared for. I will never forget these days. But I have to go back to my life now. Please understand."

On the train back home, she stares out the window at the passing landscape and wonders if she has made the right choice. The rational part of her mind says yes, of course she has. She has children, responsibilities, a life that many people would consider good.

But there is another part of her mind, a smaller but more insistent voice, that whispers: What if this was your chance? What if this was your one opportunity to be truly happy, and you just walked away from it?

She does not know the answer to this question. She supposes she never will.''',
